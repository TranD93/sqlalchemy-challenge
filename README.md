- Flask

### Trip Analysis:

Using SQLAlchemy to reflect databases to Python classes.
Retrieving and plotting the last 12 months of precipitation data using pandas.
Obtaining station statistics: total number of stations, most active stations, and temperature observations for the last 12 months (as a histogram).
Creating a Flask API to serve JSON data for precipitation values, stations, temperature observations from the last year, and temperature statistics within a specified date range.

### Additional Analyses:

Comparing June and December temperature observations using a t-test.
Bar chart of average temperature and min/max range for selected trip dates.
Daily rainfall average for chosen date range.
Side analysis on limitations of line plots for certain datasets.
